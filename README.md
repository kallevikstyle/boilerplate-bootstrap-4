# boilerplate-bootstrap-4

This is my basic boilerplate for creating a new project using Bootstrap 4 with Grunt task manager.

## Get started
1 - Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/kallevikstyle/boilerplate-bootstrap-4.git
```

2 - Navigate to local repository and install Node packages
```
npm install
```

3 - Start grunt task
```
grunt
```
It will now watch Sass files and compile CSS

## Requirements
Node.js must be installed, and the Grunt command line must be globally installed.
npm install -g grunt-cli
